## **Description**

HARMony is a combat-based music-themed video game where you begin by selecting your warrior/genre and you fight to conquer the other genres. Once you go through all the levels for one genre, you return home to rest before beginning conquering the remaining genres.  Once you beat all the genre bosses you're returned to the character-select screen to play again (with a different character if you choose).  We made this game using HTML Canvas and React components. Admittedly, we only used React as that was a requirement for the assignment.  We originally tried using the game engine Phaser.io, and would highly recommend that to anybody whom does not need to use React.
